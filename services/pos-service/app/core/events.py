"""Event publishing and subscribing interface.

MVP transport: a synchronous HTTP call from this service directly to
Inventory Service's internal event-ingestion endpoint, instead of a message
broker. No RabbitMQ (or any) broker exists anywhere in this repo yet, and
Inventory Service's consumer-side handlers (``handle_sale_completed`` etc.,
see ``services/inventory-service/app/services/event_handlers.py``) are
already written and tested — this just gives them a call site.

``publish_event`` MUST NOT let a failure here affect the caller. A sale is
the source of truth for revenue and must sync successfully even if
Inventory Service is unreachable, slow, or returns an error — the stock
deduction is a best-effort side effect, not a precondition. Every exception
is caught and logged, never re-raised.

Swapping this for a real broker later only means changing this function's
body — ``sale_service.py``'s call sites and the payload shape stay the same.
