"""Correct enum type values to match the ORM values_callable contract.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHY THIS MIGRATION EXISTS
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The ORM layer now persists enum **values** (lowercase, via
``values_callable`` on every enum column) instead of the default member
**names** (uppercase).  The initial schema already created the native
Postgres enum types with lowercase values, so a database built by
``alembic upgrade head`` is already correct.

This migration exists to guarantee the enum types hold the correct
lowercase values in ANY pre-existing database — most importantly one that
was ever created via ``SQLModel.metadata.create_all`` (the old test
strategy), which would have created the types with uppercase member
names.  Without this cleanup, such a database would now reject the
lowercase values the ORM sends.

Pre-launch status confirmed: the live ``foodlink_inventory`` database
holds only ``alembic_version`` — no business data.  The affected tables
are empty, so the enum types are simply dropped (CASCADE removes any
dependent columns) and recreated with the correct values.  This is the
deliberate drop-and-recreate approach, NOT a value-preserving
``ALTER TYPE``, because there is no data worth preserving.
