"""Schemas for Recipe / RecipeComponent (Stage 1: Recipe CRUD + batch formulas).

A recipe is a bill-of-materials for one sellable item — "Pilau = 200g rice
+ 100g meat + 20ml oil + 30g onions". Quantities are expressed in the raw
material item's own unit (the unit the stockroom counts it in), so no unit
conversion is part of this stage.

BATCH FORMULA SEMANTICS: component quantities are totals for the recipe's
``target_yield_quantity`` (e.g. "10kg rice for 50 portions"). Per-unit
math (production ratios, cost per plate) divides by the target yield; a
target of 1 reproduces the original per-unit recipe exactly.

Update semantics are full-replace, not partial-patch: ``RecipeUpdate``
carries a complete component list and the endpoint deletes-then-inserts it.
A partial "add/remove one line" patch invites lost-update races between two
editors and complicates validation (e.g. "remove the last line" must still
be rejected as an empty recipe) — replace-the-set is the simplest correct
shape, matching how the owner thinks about a recipe card.
