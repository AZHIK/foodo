"""Schemas for production events (Stage 2 + target-based planning).

Two input UX flows share one commit path:

1. LEADING-INGREDIENT flow (original): the owner measures ONE leading
   ingredient ("2kg rice") — every other consumption follows from the
   recipe ratio, and the output suggestion is pre-filled but
   owner-adjustable.
2. TARGET-OUTPUT flow (new): the owner enters how many products they want
   ("100 plates") — the app recommends every grocery amount
   (``quantity_required * target``), each line remains adjustable, and
   after cooking the owner confirms the amount actually achieved. The
   system then reports whether the yield is above / within / below the
   allowed threshold around the target.

Both flows commit through ``ProduceRequest``; the server computes the
yield verdict (never the client) so history and insights agree.
