"""Schemas for scheduled production runs (Production Module, Tab 2 + 3).

A run is a cooking batch with a lifecycle:

    pending → in_progress → completed → published
    (plan)     (inputs       (actual      (output stocked +
               deducted)      recorded)     history event)

Creation snapshots the plan (per-ingredient quantities for the target) so
later recipe edits never rewrite a cook's shift plan. Starting deducts the
measured (adjustable) inputs; completing records the actual yield and the
waste/variance reason; publishing stocks the output — the "one-click
conversion" that makes the finished item sellable on the POS — and writes
the immutable history event the yield verdict is computed from.
