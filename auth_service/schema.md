# FoodLink Auth Service Database Schema

This document explains the database schema for the FoodLink Africa authentication
and authorization service.

The auth service owns identity, sessions, platform roles, business membership,
business-level permissions, and login security. Audit persistence is owned by a
separate Audit Service that consumes `audit.recorded` events. Product data such
as sales, inventory, purchase orders, supplier prices, delivery jobs, forecasts,
and farmer production plans should live in separate domain services.

## Design Summary

FoodLink Africa is a multi-sided platform with restaurants, suppliers, farmers,
drivers, consumers, and platform staff. The schema is designed around these
needs:

- One user identity can access multiple businesses.
- Businesses can be restaurants, suppliers, farmers, distributors, or platform
  operators.
- Businesses can belong to an organization and can have multiple locations.
- Access can be granted globally, at business level, or at business-location
  level.
- Permissions can mark AI-sensitive actions and actions requiring human
  approval.
- Login, device, session, and risk data are tracked separately.
- Auditable actions publish `audit.recorded` events for a separate Audit
  Service.

Most core tables include:

- `id`: UUID primary key.
- `created_at`: creation timestamp.
- `updated_at`: last update timestamp.
- `is_deleted` and `deleted_at`: soft-delete fields where applicable.

## Audit Events

The Identity Service does not own an `audit_logs` table. Auditable actions
publish an `audit.recorded` event to the shared event bus. A separate Audit
Service is responsible for subscribing to those events and storing the durable
audit trail.

Event payload shape:

```json
{
  "actor_id": "<user id or null>",
  "actor_type": "user | system | ai_agent | service",
  "business_id": "<business id or null>",
  "action": "<string>",
  "resource_type": "<string>",
  "resource_id": "<string or null>",
  "details": {}
}
```

Identity Service actions that currently publish this event:

- Business created.
- Business role assigned.
- Business permission override created.
- Protected role edit rejected.

## Relationship Overview

The main relationship chain is:

```text
users
  -> organizations
  -> businesses
  -> business_locations
```

Access control is layered:

```text
permissions
  -> role_permissions
  -> roles
  -> user_roles

permissions
  -> business_role_permissions
  -> business_roles
  -> user_business_roles
  -> user_business_location_roles

permissions
  -> user_business_permissions
```

Authentication state is tracked through:

```text
users
  -> verification_codes
  -> refresh_tokens
  -> user_sessions
  -> trusted_devices
  -> login_attempts
  -> auth_risk_events
```

Auditability is emitted through:

```text
audit.recorded events
```
