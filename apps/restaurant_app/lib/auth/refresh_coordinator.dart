/// Process-wide coordinator for refresh-token use.
///
/// Background: the backend rotates the refresh token on EVERY use and treats
/// a second concurrent use of the same token as a replay attack
/// (`TokenReuseDetectedError` → the whole session family is revoked → every
/// later refresh 401s forever). Three components refresh independently —
/// `TokenRefreshInterceptor` (reactive 401 retry), `AuthNotifier` (cold-start
/// restore, PIN-unlock restore) and, indirectly, the provision guard (whose
/// 401s trigger the interceptor) — so without serialization two of them can
/// fire with the same one-shot token at startup and permanently kill the
/// session. A dead session means the provision guard can never verify
/// anything (`indeterminate` forever) and the app can never get online again
/// without a fresh OTP login.
///
/// Rules enforced here:
/// - exactly ONE backend refresh call is ever in flight process-wide;
///   concurrent callers share its result instead of firing their own;
/// - the token sent is always re-read from storage INSIDE the lock, so a
///   caller holding a stale captured pair transparently uses the rotated
///   pair another caller just persisted;
/// - this unit never clears storage and never interprets rejections — a 401
///   propagates to the caller, which owns the policy (interceptor:
///   clear + expire; AuthNotifier: fall back to cached offline session).
