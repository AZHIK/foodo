/// keeps the exact same human-readable id across the whole "place it,
/// prepend it locally, sync it, reload it from cache" lifecycle, rather than
/// silently swapping identity to the backend's UUID the moment a background
/// refresh reloads state from `CachedSales`. A sale synced from a different
/// device has no such row on this one — it falls back to `clientSaleId`
/// itself, which is not a pretty ticket number, but that sale was never
/// rung up on this till in the first place.
///
/// Quantity is rounded to an [int]: the backend's `Decimal` quantity exists
/// to support fractional stock (kg/L raw materials), but every sale this
/// app itself creates comes from the till's cart, which only ever sells
/// whole units (`lib/models/cart.dart`'s `CartItem.quantity` is `int`) — so
/// a fractional quantity here would only ever come from another system
/// entirely, which is out of scope.
///
/// `discountRate`/`taxRate` are derived from the server's authoritative
/// `discountAmount`/`taxAmount` against the recomputed subtotal (sum of line
/// totals) rather than stored directly, since `Order.totals` always
/// recomputes from `OrderTotals.from(subtotal, taxRate, discountRate)` — this
/// keeps a synced-back `Order`'s totals matching what the server actually
/// charged, without adding a second, parallel "totals" representation to the
