/// A bare `ProviderContainer` pre-wired with an in-memory database.

/// Every widget test that mounts `RestaurantPosApp` lands on the dashboard
/// first (even ones that immediately navigate elsewhere), and the dashboard
/// reads inventory data. `InventoryNotifier` watches `authProvider` (via
/// `currentStoreIdProvider`) to know whether a business/store context
/// exists, and `AuthNotifier.build()` unconditionally needs a working
/// database — so a bare `ProviderContainer()` with no override throws before
/// any of that context-detection logic ever runs, even for tests that don't
/// care about auth at all.
///
/// This does not seed any session/business/store state — callers that need
/// a real business context (roles, staff, permissions) still set that up
/// themselves (see `fake_identity_backend.dart`); this only stops the
/// database's "must be overridden" guard from firing.
