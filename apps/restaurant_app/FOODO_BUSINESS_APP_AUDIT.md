**Model**: [order.dart](lib/models/order.dart)

| Requirement | Status | Details |
|---|---|---|
| Order list/board with status stages | ⚠️ **Partially Present** | Sales screen shows tabular list of all orders. Status shown as badge (new/paid/refunded/voided/pending) but **NO visual kanban/board view** with status swimlanes (New → Preparing → Ready → Out for Delivery → Completed). Currently only list view. |
| Order detail view | ✅ **Present** | Full detail screen available. Shows: order lines with items, customer info (table/name if applicable), payment status, order type (dine-in/takeaway/delivery), totals. Screen: OrderDetailScreen |

| Delivery method indicator | ✅ **Present** | OrderType enum: dineIn / takeaway / delivery. Shown on order card and detail |
| Update/change order status | ⚠️ **Partially Present** | Order model has `copyWith()` but **no UI to change status from detail screen**. Would require backend hook |

---

## SECTION 2: CRITICAL MISSING FEATURES (RANKED BY MVP PRIORITY)

### **TIER 1 — BLOCKS CORE BUSINESS FUNCTION** (Fix before backend integration)

1. **Order Status Management** (Current: ⚠️ Display only | Needed: ✅ Editable)
   - Can view order status but cannot change it from PAID → READY or similar
   - Requires: Backend endpoint to update order status + UI button on order detail
   - **Business Impact**: Cannot manage kitchen workflow; POS is output-only

2. **Order Real-Time Feed** (Current: ❌ Missing)
   - No new order indicator; staff unaware of incoming orders
   - Requires: WebSocket or polling mechanism for new orders + visual indicator/bell
   - **Business Impact**: Orders sit invisible until someone manually refreshes

3. **Menu Item ↔ Inventory Reconciliation** (Current: ⚠️ Separate systems)
   - Menu and inventory are completely decoupled
   - When an item sells, stock is NOT automatically decremented
   - Requires: Backend logic to link menu items to inventory + post-sale stock update
   - **Business Impact**: Inventory counts become stale; no cost-of-goods tracking

4. **Customer Management System** (Current: ❌ Missing)
   - No customer entity; orders are anonymous POS tickets
   - Cannot track repeat customers, order history per customer, or loyalty
   - Requires: Customer model + lookup/creation screen + order ↔ customer link
   - **Business Impact**: No customer insights or repeat business tracking

### **TIER 2 — SIGNIFICANT GAPS** (Should be in Phase 1)

5. **Supplier Integration** (Current: ❌ Missing entirely)
   - No way to request restock, track supplier responses
   - Inventory item has supplier name (text) but no supplier entity or request workflow
   - Requires: Supplier model + request management screen + supplier feedback/status
   - **Business Impact**: Restocking is manual/offline; no procurement visibility

6. **Rider / Delivery Coordination** (Current: ❌ Missing entirely)
   - Delivery is an order type, but no rider assignment or tracking
   - No way to communicate delivery status to customer or assign orders to riders
   - Requires: Rider entity + assignment UI + status tracking + customer notification
   - **Business Impact**: Delivery orders cannot be fulfilled from app

7. **Persistent Notification System** (Current: ⚠️ Partial)
   - Alerts are embedded in screens (dashboard) but no notification center
   - No notification history, read/unread state, or persistent notifications
   - Requires: Notification model + center screen + push notification integration
   - **Business Impact**: Staff misses critical alerts (low stock, new order, AI warnings)

### **TIER 3 — MVP NICE-TO-HAVE** (Post-launch iteration)

8. **Kanban Order Board** (Current: ⚠️ List only)
   - Orders shown as table, not visual swimlanes (New → Preparing → Ready → Delivered)
   - Requires: Board view with drag-drop status updates
   - **Business Impact**: Kitchen workflow less visual but functional with current list

9. **Demand Forecasting** (Current: ❌ Missing)
   - No ML model or predictive display for busy periods
   - Requires: Backend ML + forecast rendering
   - **Business Impact**: Nice insight but not blocking operations

10. **Peak Sales Period Heatmap** (Current: ❌ Missing)
    - No hour-of-day or day-of-week analysis
    - Requires: Data aggregation + heatmap widget
    - **Business Impact**: Nice-to-have analytics; operations work without it

11. **Subscription / Premium Tiers** (Current: ❌ Missing)
    - No plan selection or feature gates
    - Requires: Plan model + gating logic
    - **Business Impact**: Post-MVP monetization layer

## SECTION 5: SCOPE CREEP ALERTS (Features NOT in Concept Note)

### **What's in the app but NOT in the MVP brief:**

1. **Finance/Expenses Module** (`/finance/expenses`, `/finance/incomes`)
   - Full expense and income tracking with categorization
   - Not mentioned in concept note
   - ⚠️ **Verdict**: May be out-of-scope; clarify if needed for P1 or defer to P2

2. **Staff Roles & Permissions System**
   - Complete role management with permission strings
   - Granular access control (order.view, inventory.edit, etc.)
   - ✅ **Verdict**: Good to have; supports multi-user business model

3. **Store Management & Locations**
   - Multi-location support in settings
   - ✅ **Verdict**: Reasonable for future scaling

4. **Chat / Communication Dialog** (`chat_dialog.dart`)
   - General chat widget
   - Not clear what it's for (rider comms? internal? customer?)
   - ⚠️ **Verdict**: Clarify if needed; might be for staff/rider comms

5. **Table Query / Seating Allocation**

---

## SECTION 6: UI QUALITY & COMPLETENESS SUMMARY

### **What Works Well:**
- ✅ Comprehensive data models for core entities
- ✅ Clean, modular screen structure (detail pages, data tables, dialogs)
- ✅ Consistent design system & theming
- ✅ Responsive layout (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- ✅ Solid state management (Riverpod providers)
- ✅ Test coverage for key screens and dialogs
- ✅ Export and filtering for data pages
- ✅ Onboarding and auth flows complete

### **What Needs Attention Before Backend:**
1. **Wire up menu ↔ inventory relationship** — Critical for consistency
2. **Add order status update UI** — Required for kitchen workflow
3. **Create customer entity & screens** — Missing major business domain
4. **Add notification center** — Alerts are scattered, not persistent
5. **Create supplier management flow** — Currently text-only
6. **Implement order real-time polling/WebSocket** — No new order visibility

---

## SECTION 7: RECOMMENDED BACKEND INTEGRATION ORDER

### **Phase 1A — Core Order-to-Payment Flow** (Week 1-2)
1. Hook Orders list & detail screens to backend
2. Implement order status update endpoint & UI
3. Wire menu item creation/update/delete
4. Connect inventory stock adjustments

### **Phase 1B — Inventory & Supplier** (Week 2-3)
1. Implement inventory restock request workflow
2. Add supplier management screens
3. Link menu items → inventory for auto-deduction

### **Phase 2 — Customers & Notifications** (Week 3-4)
1. Implement customer registration & lookup
2. Add customer order history linking
3. Build notification system (database + UI center)

### **Phase 2+ — Riders & Advanced** (Week 4+)
1. Rider assignment and tracking
2. Real-time order status WebSocket
3. Demand forecasting and advanced analytics
